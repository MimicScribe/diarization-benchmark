# MimicScribe Diarization Benchmark Results

Pipeline: Parakeet TDT 0.6B (on-device ASR) + Pyannote (on-device diarization) + Gemini 3 Flash (LLM speaker attribution)

Run date: 2026-03-29

Collar: 0.25s (standard)

## Benchmark vs Production

These results represent a **worst-case scenario** for the MimicScribe pipeline. In normal use, the pipeline has several advantages not available in this benchmark:

- **Mic/system audio separation**: MimicScribe captures the user's microphone and system audio (remote participants) as separate streams. This gives the diarization a free speaker separation signal — the primary user is always identified from the mic channel, and remote speakers are a distinct pool. In this benchmark, all speakers come from a single mixed audio file with no channel distinction.
- **Voice profiles**: Users can save voice profiles that provide verified speaker recognition with high confidence. The benchmark has no saved profiles.
- **Meeting context**: Users can provide prep context (e.g., "Meeting with Alice and Bob about Q3") that helps the LLM identify speakers. The benchmark has no context.
- **Segment granularity**: The pipeline outputs sentence-level segments because that's what users read. DER penalizes this heavily — silent gaps within a sentence count as false alarm — but it is a deliberate UX choice, not a diarization failure. This accounts for the majority of the false alarm rate.
